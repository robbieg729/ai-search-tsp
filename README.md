# Using AI Search to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)
This is an assignment which finds solutions for the TSP using two different AI Search algorithms. For each of the two algorithms, a basic implementation and an enhanced
implementation exist. AISearchProforma.pdf contains the names of the two algorithms and the enhancements made to both. The Tours folder contains the best tours found on
10 different city graphs, with their sizes indicated in the file names. Achieved a mark of 80%. Note this code will not run as it is currently, as it needs additional
files specifying the distance matrices and algorithm codes which are not uploaded.
